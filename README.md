# Why Go Solo

## History
Why Go Solo was an business created by a local business owner while I was studying at Bangor University. Unfortunately due to funding issues the project was shelved and given to the local business owner to fund themselves.

## Description
The software aimed to allow people who were new to a town to organize events and meet up as well as local businesses to host their own events. This system was designed to later be monetized with a lot of input from the team working together to create a solid idea.

## Involvement
The Why Go Solo team was split into two small teams each with different responsibilities. As the system architect I worked closely with both in order to produce a working application that worked with the teams front end and the RESTful API.

## Final System
The final system was a working success with features such as login, searching from a server database, editing a user profile, registering, creating events. However due to a small working window a few features were missing in the final system and the code base was handed over to the small business owner who started the project.
